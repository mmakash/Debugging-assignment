                        Session Storage is similar to Local Storage ; The difference is that while data in localStorage
                        doesn't expire, 
                        data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a
                        particular tab in the browser,
                        a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab

                    The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block statements (e.g. if
                    conditions or for
                    loops), don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because the variables
                    are still in the
                    same scope. ES6 introduced block scope by using the let and const keywords

                <p class="fs-5 blog-details mx-auto">
                    The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the
                    Call Stack is empty, the
                    Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
                    which effectively runs it. Such
                    an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
